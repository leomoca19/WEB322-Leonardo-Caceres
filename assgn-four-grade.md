## Total Score: 100 / 100

Leo! Awesome work here.  I am so impressed I am going to overlook the one bug if found in your code.  Look in the api routes
file and see if you can see it.  It's more of a typo that a functional thing.

One small thing.   Google .env files.  The way you store your credentials is fine but .env is a defacto standard.   Also - I had to 
run this against my own db since i didn't have your credentials. That is nitpicking though.  Great work!

You also got the bonus so let me know how you'd like to apply it.
